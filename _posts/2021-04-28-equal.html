<p>So what does it mean to be a leftist? Do you want to know if you might be a leftist?

Sometimes people try to overcomplicate this question, but Iâ€™m a simple guy when it comes these ideas. So in this post I want to describe what it means to be a leftist in simple general terms. There are lots of nuanced ways to be a leftist, but they are all united by a single big idea: equality.
