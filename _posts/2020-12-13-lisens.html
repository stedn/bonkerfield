<p>For the past year, my <a href="https://will.stedden.org/2020/03/introducing-viewfoil-my-experiment-with.html">viewfoil project</a> has led me to expand my use of identity publication (aka social media) and consolidate my public technological identity footprint into <a href="https://will.stedden.org/">one portal</a> online.  My long-term goal with the project is to form an artificial intelligence simulation of my personal online behavior. In other words, I aim to someday build an algorithm that can replicate and potentially replace the portion of my mind that generates behavioral artifacts on the internet.</p>

But this forces me to ask a question:
<blockquote>
If I can pursue self-simulation with the data I am collecting, should any entity that comes into possession of such data be allowed to pursue a simulation of my mind?
</blockquote>

<p>When researching this question, I realized that I couldn't find a very specific resolution to this in our current legal and ethical discussions about the intersection of data usage and sociological modeling.  To close that gap, I came up with the idea to intentionally license the ability for others to simulate my own consciousness, which I've dubbed <strong>the lisens</strong>.</p>

<h5>What would it mean to simulate consciousness?</h5>

<p>What it means <em>to be oneself</em> is one of the toughest questions to answer. Some current experiments simulating <a href="https://lexfridman.com/deeptweets/">public figures with AI</a> makes us question where the line should be drawn. Is knowing how I might finish a sentence the same as knowing how I think?  Probably not. Truth be told, our current machine learning models are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17138854/cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-trump-campaign-psychographic-microtargeting">limited</a> in their ability to replicate human decision making at all.  </p>

<p>But this limitation won't necessarily be the case forever. As we increase our capacity to simulate people's behavior, some <a href="https://www.space.com/41749-elon-musk-living-in-simulation-rogan-podcast.html">notable</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/">figures</a> have begun to point out that a sufficiently elaborate <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-live-in-a-simulation-chances-are-about-50-50/">simulation</a> could in fact start to take on properties of self-awareness that could make the lived experience of simulation and reality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat">indistinguishable</a>. A form of this idea was evoked memorably in the Matrix films. </p>

<p>There are many reasons<a href="#reason">*</a> that such a simulation could be invented, but perhaps the most popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis#The_simulation_argument">explanation</a> would be that as our society improves our simulation techniques, we could start to build simulations that could reconstruct our past. As an example, imagine that a socioligist of the future is trying to figure out what the hell happened in 2020 so she builds a model for how every person in the country voted in this election. </p>

<p>In the most extremely detailed simulation imaginable, the people simulated would actually feel as though they were really alive and making the decisions that you and I are making now. </p>

<h5>The ethics of consciousness simulation</h5>

<p>If all of this consciousness simulation sounds incredibly unethical that is because it certainly is. Of course, it becomes decidely less unethical if you can obtain <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/informed-consent">informed consent</a> from the person whose consciousness is to be simulated.  I assume that future researchers will be at least ethical enough to require this kind of consent, but this leads me to wonder whether there will be a lack of willing subjects from our era of history. In light of this, I asked myself whether it would be good idea to try to publicly declare my own consent to aid future researchers of human consciousness.</p>

<p>This caused me to arrive at the concept of a lisens (license of sense of self). The exact content of the lisens is still a work-in-progress, but you can see the current contents on <a href="https://will.stedden.org/lisens">my personal website</a>.</p>

<p>I will address my reasons for why I feel comfortable lisens-ing myself in another post. At the very least, I hope that publicizing my decision to adopt a lisens should raise awareness to future researchers that they should definitely NOT simulate anyone's mind without determining whether the person in question had adopted a lisens themselves. As deep-learning impersonation models improve over the next few years, this may become important sooner than one might expect.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about adopting a lisens for yourself, please feel free to reach out to me.  If there is enough interest in this concept, I want to start to build an easily accessible <a href="https://github.com/stedn/lisens-index">index</a> that could allow future researchers to find those who would be willing to participate in a future simiulation of themselves. Or, perhaps <em>the present</em> simulation...</p>

<p ><small><strong>*PS:</strong> I actually suspect the most likely reason for why we would be simulated would not be to simulate the past. I think a better explanation would be to validate whether consciousness simulations in the future work well by testing them on data from the past.</small></p>
