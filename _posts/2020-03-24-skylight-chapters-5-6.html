<p>
    Three years ago, I started writing a story called <em>Skylight</em>. The story takes place in another solar system where society never looked up and wondered about the stars, until one day, they did.  Over the past year, my <a href="https://a.ttent.io/n">attention</a> was diverted to another project, but shelter-in-place has given me some free time to finish Chapters 5 and 6.  For context, I've posted <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2018/05/skylight-chapters-1-2/">Chapters 1 & 2</a> and <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2018/06/skylight-chapters-3-4/">Chapters 3 & 4</p> previously.

    Hope you like it. I'll try to get 7 and 8 out a lot quicker.
