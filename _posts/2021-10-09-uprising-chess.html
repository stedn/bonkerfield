<p>What do you see when you look at a chessboard?  Two rows of expendable pawns march into battle to protect the interests of the nobility, convinced to fight solely because they happen to be a different color. Sacrificing their lives to protect a bumbling and ineffectual king.  The game itself is a blueprint for the kind of society the rulers wanted back when it was invented.  All of us regular people convinced to fight each other for the comfort of a few.

I wrote new rules for a chess game called Uprising Chess that pits the pawns against the noble pieces. And just like in life, in this game the nobles only maintain their special moves if they can keep the pawns in their place.
