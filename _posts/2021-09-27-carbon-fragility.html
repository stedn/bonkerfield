<p>Our climate is changing, possibly irreversibly. When asked in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/21/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts/">polls</a>, most everyone understands this. We even know how to stop it and yet in our day-to-day public interactions, very few people seem to be willing to talk about any of this.

<p>
I've developed a theory to explain this, and I've termed it Carbon Fragility, an environmental correlate to the phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_defensiveness">white fragility</a>.
