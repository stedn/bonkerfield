<p>
The process of changing the world has 3 interrelated parts:

</p>

<ol>
<li>Acknowledge where we are</li>

<li>Define where we want to be</li>

<li>Take steps to move in the right direction</li>
</ol>

<p>
In this essay I want to go into why itâ€™s important to remember that all 3 parts have a place and not to let 1 part dominate the others.
