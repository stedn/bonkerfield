After the recent migration from Twitter to Mastodon, there have been numerous occasions where.

The nature of the fediverse is decentralized, which offers benefits and downsides. The chief downside is that some people can join "Mastodon," but end up on servers where moderation is non-existent.  As a way to offer , I thought I would develop a user-centric moderation technique.

With this form of moderation, Mastodon users give us access to their server so that we can employ automated scripts to scout their local timelines and replies. We then pass that content through automated filters to search for offensive posts, and create a large centralized list of aggressive and caustic comments.  With that information we can then come out to help anyone who is being targeted for harassment.

It's a different approach, and one that I hadn't seen mentioned anywhere else. I had trouble getting any feedback, positive or negative, about the idea, and so I decided I'd try to flesh out a prototype to help others think through the concept.
