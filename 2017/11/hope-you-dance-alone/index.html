Basically, he does an unbelievably amazing job of squeezing tons of irony and kitsch out of a bunch of 90s and 2000s songs. His work has a very DIY feel, and it very much comes out of the internet culture, but the work is really impeccable and just sooo funny.</p><img border="0" src="https://images.genius.com/7748ece5191c0a368b5ea02112649286.800x800x1.jpg" title=" "/><p> <i>btw, I just looked up the links for Neil Cicierega and ended up spending the last two hours listening to his music again.</i></p><p> Anyway, <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery.html">imitation is the sickest form of flattery</a> so I decided I would play around with mashing up a couple of tunes myself. I've always liked the idea of merging dance music with country music because the only famous example is the <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/82584/long-history-behind-song-cotton-eye-joe">notably horrible Cotton Eye Joe</a>. After deciding to do a country tune merged with a dance songe, the obvious choice for me was the classic <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column-column.html">wear your suncreen</a> of the south: <a href="http://www.greatamericanthings.net/music/songs-music/song-i-hope-you-dance/">Hope you dance</a> by appropriately triple named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ann_Womack">Lee Ann Womack</a>. For the dance track, I decided to just mash it up with an instrumental of Marshmello's Alone for the sole reason that I just think that track is great.</p><p> Here's my mashup on youtube dubbed over clips from the original music video. It's not great, but I kind of like it in a weird way. Read below for more on how to make a track like this.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnhhmN9PJGk" width="560"></iframe><h3>The Audacity of Dope</h3><p> All the music editing took place using the <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> open source music editor. The community surrounding this software is great and there are already a ton of tutorials to get you started. I'm going to focus primarily on the process for grabbing a bunch of music that you like off of youtube and putting it together.</p><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iWerQHgB8iA/WTo34SWZIUI/AAAAAAAAIYw/pmq0Z4aeKHgPDVMERkuKsa7iqJ-BxOg7QCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2017-06-08%2B22-51-12.png" title=" "/><h6>downloading some audio</h6><p> The first step is to download music. I got all of mine off of youtube using <a href="https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter">this site</a>. Since this was just a fun project, I didn't fuss too much with getting really good audio. My primary focus was trying to get music with audio and instrumental separated so that I could merge them without having the instruments conflict. I was able to do that for Alone, but old country songs don't have a very wide remixing community so I had to make due on my own.</p><h6>removing instrumentals</h6><p> I played around with a couple of the examples in <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_vocal_removal_and_isolation.html">this tutorial</a> from Audacity. They worked to a certain degree, but there are still fragments of instruments in the background of the Womack track. I just went with it and tried to incorporate them in a musical way.</p><h6>beat matching</h6>Once I had the music and vocals more or less isolated, there was one crucial step called beat matching. basically, the two songs were in very different tempos so I tried to get them close to the same speed so that I could merge them without the two tracks getting out of sync. To do this, I first estimated the bpm of the songs by tapping to the beat on an <a href="http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm">online bpm tool</a>. This gave me a relative difference in tempo, which I could use to adjust one of the tracks using Audacity's <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/change_tempo.html">change tempo feature</a>. <img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2KRmZpY6twg/WTowqENdMzI/AAAAAAAAIYg/z_JlyQx7DM8HxsPV9pIHx7WSqdLyypZ3gCLcB/s1600/change_tempo_w10.png" title=" "/><h6>slice and dice</h6><p> After this, basically all I did was slice audio clips, and copy and paste them into an Audacity project with the instrumental running in the background. I <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/change_pitch.html">changed the pitch</a> of the clips in different ways in different places, but I just adjusted the pitch by ear until it sounded sort of OK. Occasionally, I'd just start throwing random effects onto clips, but I never really kept track of what I was doing so I can't really describe what I did there.</p><p> Long story short, you just have to play around for a long time to massage the clips into the surrounding beat track. This took me about 4 nights of continuous work and then another maybe three or four where I would just poke around for 15 minutes. I suspect that the next time I do this it will take significantly less time, but I will end up with a significantly better project. I didn't have too high of hopes so the product I ended up with was good enough for me to finalize the project and move on.</p><h3>Throwing together a video</h3><p> Finally, I really wanted to see this weird new song stitched back in with the original music video. So I went about getting a copy of the video from youtube. If you don't know already, all you have to do to download a youtube video is add ss to the url as described <a href="http://www.nairaland.com/1934159/how-download-youtube-videos-using">here</a> (and a moillion other places online.</p><p> After you download the mp4, you can edit in any video editor. I used this really janky program called <a href="https://www.shotcut.org/">ShotCut</a>, but I would not recommend it. It served its purpose for me, but I'm sure there must be better video editing packages out there.</p><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ztl7NFEjQw/WTo4DMnOYnI/AAAAAAAAIY0/Q_i-Cws8TbwfnkxKB06EBGjm7rAw1aSJQCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2017-06-08%2B22-52-11.png" title=" "/><p> I won't describe how to slice and dice a video up, but I will give you a few suggestions if you want to upload a copyrighted video to youtube. After you do all the editing, just add a ton of crazy filters so that none of the original video appears in its original condition in your final product. Otherwise youtube will block it automatically.</p><p> Note: I think this is all legal because it falls under fair use, but then again, I'm not a lawyer so if anybody cease and desists you, just take it down and don't fight them. That probably won't happen if you make something as crappy as the music I made, but keep it in mind.</p><br/></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep" /></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"><h3 class="post__discussion">Discussion Around the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Web</a></h3><div id="webmentions"></div><hr style="margin: 5px 0;" class="sep" /><p>Join the Conversation</p><form target="_blank" name="tweet" action="https://twitter.com/share" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="original_referer" value="https://bonkerfield.org/2017/11/hope-you-dance-alone/"> <input type="hidden" name="source" value="bonkerfield"> <textarea style="border-color:#aaa;" id="textar" name="text" maxlength="140"></textarea> <input type="hidden" name="url" value="https://bonkerfield.org/2017/11/hope-you-dance-alone/"> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-social btn-tw" type="submit" id="button"> <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> <br/>comment by tweet </button> </form><hr style="margin: 5px 0;" class="sep" /> <form target="_blank" name="tweet" action="https://www.reddit.com/submit" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="source" value="bonkerfield"> <textarea style="border-color:#aaa;" id="textar" name="title" maxlength="140"></textarea> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-social btn-rd" type="submit" id="button"> <i class="fab fa-reddit-alien"></i> <br/>submit to reddit </button> <input type="hidden" name="url" value="https://bonkerfield.org/2017/11/hope-you-dance-alone/"> </form> <script src="/assets/js/webmention.min.js"></script></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="https://bonkerfield.org/2017/11/hope-you-dance-alone/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ztl7NFEjQw/WTo4DMnOYnI/AAAAAAAAIY0/Q_i-Cws8TbwfnkxKB06EBGjm7rAw1aSJQCLcB/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2017-06-08%2B22-52-11.png" alt="hope you dance (alone)" /></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">hope you dance (alone)</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="subscribe" id="subscribe"><div class="subscribe__container"> <span class="subscribe__title">Subscribe</span><p class="subscribe__text">Get an update when I post new content.</p><form method="POST" action="https://bonkerfield.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post-json?u=68d1146ea8fe327def203f254&amp;id=e88ba623c5&amp;c=?" id="mc-signup" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"> <input type="text" name="b_68d1146ea8fe327def203f254_e88ba623c5" tabindex="-1" value=""></div><div class="form-group"> <input id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Email Address"></div><div class="form__btn"> <input id="mc-submit" type="submit" value="Sign Up" name="subscribe"></div></form><p class="subscribe__error hidden"></p></div></div><hr class="sep--white"/><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://sigmoid.social/@bonkerfield" rel="me" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willstedden" rel="me" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/stedn" rel="me" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bonkerfield" rel="me" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li></ul><div class="posts__pagination"> <span>This site is maintained by <a href="https://will.stedden.org">Will Stedden</a>.
