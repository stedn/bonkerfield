<p>Although I’m a huge fan of spreading the wealth to make working people’s lives better off, I’m most fascinated by the possibility that economic democracy could actually make our market economy even more efficient and intelligent by spreading out decision making power to more and more people.</p>

<p>Recent events have definitively proven that even smart and successful business-people can make huge blunders when they are given too much centralized decision making power.  The goal of democracy is partially to make sure that any new ideas need to be filtered through a lot more brains before bad decisions can be made.</p>

<p>But in the last part of this article, I’d like to focus on one key feature where the worker cooperative</p>

<p>There are two separate but interelated things that would come with transitioning to a system of equal ownership.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A more equitable distribution of wealth</li>
  <li>A more equitable distribution of decision-making power</li>
</ol>

<p>If you divided up the total value of the US economy and redistributed it equally to all citizens, everyone would have about 1 million dollars in net assets.  That might sound quite absurd at first, and the ramifications of an overnight transfer of wealth like that would be quite destabilizing.</p>

<p>However, if you break down where that wealth sits, and what it would really mean to redistribute it, you start to see the bigger picture.</p>

<p>The median home in the US is about $Xk, so a big chunk of that 1mil owuld just be everyone having ownership over the roof above their head.  After housing, the majority of the remainder of the wealth is in the capital assets of businesses.</p>

<p>So for most citizens that wealth is simply embodied in their place of business.  Today, that wealth isn’t controlled by the worker, but in a just and equitable economy, we’d find that every worker has a significant stake in their own company.</p>
