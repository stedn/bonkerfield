Cory Blythe thought she had such a small idea.

"Maybe it'll be a fun experiment," she thought, walking into the All Hands meeting at the Dayton Bicycle Factory.  She'd been daydreaming about it all Sunday, watching her backyard garden soaking up another torrential downpour of a Midwestern thunderstorm.

It'd been the third week in a row that her kayaking trip up the Little Miami River had been postponed.  She was heartbroken.  She'd been riding that river with her family every year since she was 10.  But it was already getting late into the Fall, and if the weather didn't hold up in the next two weeks, it'd be too cold to go this year.

That's when she had her little idea.  And this was the morning she'd walk up to her manager and ask, "Why not?"

Six years later, Cory could have never expected the effects of that short conversation.  Her heart was racing, standing in the wing at the main stage of the Design, Insight, and Vision conference.  She'd grown more accustomed to the limelight in the following years as she became the national spokesperson for the Regional Unified Workweek, but even then, speaking at the DIV conference was a huge step for her.

The conference host finished her introduction on the stage, and Cory heard her name spoken over the loudspeakers.  She stepped onto the stage to cheers and applause and walked to the mark on the floor where the conference choreographers had instructed her to deliver her speech.

"Thank you everyone for coming," she began, "for those of you who don't think one little conversation can change the world, I'm here to let you know that when the time is right, everthing can change."

"As you all know, the Regional Unified Workweek or RUW has reshaped the way most workers colloborate across the planet.  For those of you who still work the conventional workweek, first off, I'm sorry I haven't convinced your bosses yet."

A round of laughter echoed through the packed auditorium.

"But in case you don't know, the RUW is a way to coordinate."

"It all started with a simple question.  Why did I have to be in the Dayton Bicycle Factory when the sun was shining and at home on a rainy day?  The solution was simple. Our factory only operated 4 days a week so why not pick which 4 days based on when it was most likely to rain."

"Some ideas seem so simple.  The first time I said it out loud, my manager stared at me like I was speaking another language."

The audience laughed.

"The second time I said it, she laughed.  That might have been your response when you first heard it."

The audience laughed again.

"But by the third time I brought it up,  The manager's son had already missed two weeks of baseball games due to rain.  She'd gone home and done some calculations.  She'd played it through her head and discussed it casually with another colleague working in the shipping department of the factory."

"By the fourth time," Cory said, "no one could understand why we hadn't made this change years ago."

The audience erupted in applause.

### Memories

In the technical poster session outside the conference, Cory's wrist was beginning to ache.  She'd already shaken about a hundred people's hands during their conversations about the details and how this change had sparked so many reimaginings of the workplace.

They'd talked about how much better traffice was now that everyone's schedules had become flexible.  They talked about how planning on the WEEK system had improved efficiency and decreased worker burnout.  And of course, they talked about how the WEEK brought essential workers to a place where they had as much right to a flexible and well-balanced life as the Work From Home crowd had enjoyed for years.  They even talked about how moving to the WEEK system had brought on so many other changes like decreasing the number of working hours needed, and

As the session was drawing to a close, an elderly woman who had been standing quietly along the periphery finally walked up to Cory and nodded a silent 'Hello.'
