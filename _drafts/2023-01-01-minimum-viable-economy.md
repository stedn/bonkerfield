It struck me in the middle of the night a few days ago.  Why are people in the United States having to work 40 hours per week?  That was the length of the work week almost 100 years ago, and we've invented millions of time-saving inventions since then. Hell, scientists have discovered that even hunter gatherer societies were only working 15-25 hours per week.

There must be something wrong.  If you're making minimum wage in the US ($7.25/hour), the amount of work to get above the poverty line ($12,880/year) is 32 hours a week.  And as we all know, even getting above the poverty line doesn't necessarily mean stability and long-term healthy survival.

Something is very, very wrong.  The numbers are not adding up.  Why in the most technologically advanced nation in the world, can a person do hard manual work for 40 hours a week and not know for sure if they will be able to survive?

To find the answer, I wanted to find out what are the total number of hours worked on those things needed for everyone in the United States to live a healthy life.  I mean what's the total amount of work needed to keep every American fed, housed, clothed, cared for, and educated.

Why does this matter?  Because if a working person needs to spend more time working than it should take to keep everyone thriving, then clearly our whole social system is broken.  And something radical should change.

## What do we need to meet our basic needs?

To be really specific, I want to know what is the minimum number hours of work should it take to meet everyone's basic needs given our modern technology. We need to come up with some minimal way to define those needs ().  To start, lets use the UN's Declaration of Human Rights to figure out the minimal list of things human beings deserve, specifically the right to an adequate standard of living.

> Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

Looking at this statement, it would help to break down a few of the items into a little more detail and expand on what I interpret it means to give a person these things. Keeping in mind that I'm really looking for an upper bound on the estimate, in places where it's hard to determine exactly the minimum necessary, I'll double the current size of an industry's labor force as an estimate[^1].

- food: 2500 calories per day, delivered to your house, and kept preserved for long enough to be reasonably restocked
- infrasctructure: not included above, but certainly necessary to make things work. This includes road energy, water, telecommunications and trucking. We'll just use estimates of the amount of current infrastructure work as a baseline.
- clothing: enough clothes to keep you warm, plus the ability to keep them clean
- housing: equivalent to a 1 bedroom apartment, and adequate energy to stay warm through winter
- medical care: highly variable and difficult to assess, so we'll use the current size of the nurse/doctor/medicine sector as a benchmark
- social services: (TODO: delineate exactly which social services are to be counted) also difficult to judge so will use the current workforces as an estimate.
- right to security...: we'll make sure we are doing enough work to continue to cover the needs of children, the elderly, and the disabled population.

I expect this list to be the bulk of things needed at a minimum for a stable and dignified life.  To me, none of these things should be extravagant in a stable, technologically advanced democracy.  And while there may be a few luxuries that we may want layered on top of these, I'm interested only in how much work a person should realistically need to do before they are at least carrying their own weight.

## The calculations

In this section, I'll be breaking down detailed assumptions and adding lots of data to make estimates of the amount of work needed for each of the above.  For reference, we are going to be using 330 million as the total US population that needs to be supported.


#### Food

I'll start with food simply because it may be the easiest to derive from first principles.  There are many great studies from agricultural schools about the amount of labor that it takes to grow and harvest an acre of many different foods.  Because we are trying to meet the minimum requirements for sustenance when it comes to food, we'll look only at plant-based foods because we know that meat and dairy take much more input per calorie[^2].  Compiling the labor data for these sources it takes X, Y, Z hours of labor total for one acre of X, Y, and Z crops, respectively.  These are example crops, but they are more or less representative of all the plant based foods needed to .  An acre of each of these crops gives X, Y, Z total calories so we can calculate the number of hours per calorie for each.  You can see that the number of hours per calorie ranges from A to B so taking even the most conservative estimate, and multiplying by a generous 2500 calories per day, gets us to Q hours of work per day to feed a single person.  Scaling this up to the whole 330 million and multiplying by all 365 days gets us to P hours of work needed for all the farming.

Transportation of goods is covered in the next section on infrastructure, but we still need to account for some level of processing.  As an upper bound on the time required for processing, we can look to our own homes. Certainly, chopping and cooking in our own homes should be the least efficient case for food processing so it can work as an upper bound on the labor required for survival.  If this is the case, I can say from personal experience that the labor of food preparation for a 2500 calorie diet can be done in less than 1 hour per day. This means 365 hours per person per year or 120 billion hours per year for everyone.

Now importantly, farming requires equipment and materials, which need to be manufactured.  Just focusing on tractors made in the US, my best estimate is that somewhere around 30-50k are sold a year.  And a combine has approximately 3 times as many parts as an automobile.  Now a traditional gas vehicle only requires between 6 and 20 person-hours to build, because most of the parts are built in highly automated processes at this point.  So we can estimate between 1 and 3 million person-hours in the production of the tractors and combines in the US.  Now to be on the safe side, lets assume that we've missed half of the equipment created each year and using the most conservative estimate we get 6 million person-hours per year.

Finally, fertilizers are important in conventional farming.  For my estimate, I'm just going to use the size of the reported job market for fertilizer manufacturing of 41,000 jobs in the US.  Again assuming the 38 hours average per week we end up with an additional 81 million hours of work.

Combining these together we get

#### Infrastructure

Infrastructure is a sprawling, unwieldy term that folds into it so many parts of our day-to-day life. Since it would be very complicated to break down the interaction of our lives with every facet of our infrastructure, I'll take a different approach.  I will just look at the current number of people working full time jobs in an infrastructure-related industry and assume that we need all that work.  It's a sloppy way to get an exact number, but I am only interested in an upper bound on this estimate, meaning I can be very conservative and use the existing state of affairs in our economy as a baseline.

Looking at a reliable reference, it appears that 17 million Americans are working on our infrastructure, and using the average of 38 hours worked per week on average, we would get to 33.5 billion hours of work in infrastructure each year.

#### Clothing

This is one where the production of the industry <em>far</em> exceeds the needs of survival.  I'm going to go with my own personal wardrobe here, which consists of just 3 pairs of pants, shirts, sweatshirts, underwear, socks, and one pair of shoes.  If it seems minimalist, well it lets me survive and that's what we're going for here.  I'd say that on average one of those items wears out every year, so lets set that as the replacement rate and see how much labor it would take to create all of that.

A large item of clothing appears to take somewhere between 2 and 10 hours to make so lets use 6 hours on average.  I would guess that socks and underwear take considerably less time, but lets go with 2 hours just to be safe.  Finally, I couldn't find the exact number for shoes, but seeing as they seem quite complicated and seem to be in the same price range as the more complex clothing items, I will use 10 hours as the estimate.  Giving 32 hours of labor for all clothing made in one year for one person.

Scaling this across the whole population, results in 10 billion hours of work on clothing per year.

#### Housing

Housing is a bit trickier, but using a


## The final tally

Keep in mind for a second that we frequently made our best estimate and then just doubled that value.  We padded and made sure not to skimp on any calculation.  And where did we end up if we tally across all our needs being met?

XX billion person-hours per year.

So what does that mean for our working-aged population of 160 million people? Well, that we should all only need to be working about X00 hours or only 5-10 hours a week.

So why do we work 3, 4, or 5 times that much?  Is it all due to those inumerable "luxuries" we fill our lives with?  For some of us that may be the case, but keep in mind that the things we've covered make up the bulk of the income of the median citizen.  Most of us are probably not making enough extra money to afford that many luxuries relative to the cost of these necessities we are paying for.

The truth is that we are all working for the luxurious extravagances of a small subset of our population. There is a slice of our society that makes hundreds of thousands of dollars doing things like "investment banking" or "actuarial services" who often don't contribute directly to the well-being of the average working person.
