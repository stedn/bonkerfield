Growing up, the Marzdan Brothers could never agree on anything. Not on what to eat, not on what to do.

That was what made it so astonishing when they joined their family for Christmas in 2028 and discovered that they had both signed up to take part in the ECHO Project.

### Across the dinner table

"Where did you hear about it?" Rolph asked his brother.

"They were talking about it at the range," Eduard replied.

"That's fascinating," Rolph said.  He tried to keep himself from cringing when his brother mentioned the shooting range.  Eduard spent most of his weekends unloading clip after clip into the targets.  Meanwhile, Rolph had declared himself an absolute pacifist years prior. He continued, "so were the rest of the guys at the range interested in it as well."

"Pretty much, yeah," Eduard said, "most of them are sick of hearing the same bullshit coming from the mainstream media, and they're realizing that FOX is bought and paid for too."

Rolph couldn't believe what he was hearing.  "Fascinating," he muttered breathlessly.

Rolph's interests in the ECHO Project had been more philosophical when he heard about it.  He wanted to hear more first hand accounts from people like himself.  He hadn't quite imagined the way ECHO would capture people's attention, but he loved to see his friends get interested in it.  Still, he'd never have imagined that his brother would ever take part.

There was something big happening.

### Egalitarian Communication Hierarchy Overthrow

The ECHO Project didn't have leaders or founders. It had almost accidentally fallen together as a bunch of communication focused web3 companies fell apart after the last crypto crash.  A bunch of disillusioned programmers and working people started self-publishing tools to consume social media differently.

"Crowd-sourced, open, random," were the first principles, but things progressed quickly.

The concept was that we all need to hear unique voices, but we also want to hear stuff that's useful.  So we built algorithms that gave you a feed of things that were useful to you, but from lots of different small sources.  Viral was no longer a thing you wanted, and neither was having a ton of followers.

Basically the new algorithms shut down anyone who wanted to be an "influencer."  You could normally get a few thousand people to see what you made, but after that the algorithm actually wound down the ability for the content to spread.  The only way for your creation to stay alive was for another creator to actively remix it with their own modifications.

And once some new random awesome video came into your feed, it was easy to go track down and give props to the original creator. The difference was that the machine couldn't force feed everybody the same crap, and that meant it couldn't be controlled.

### Rolph

If he was being honest, Rolph Marzdan's favorite part of joining ECHO was that he didn't have to see the advertisements anymore. Not that he ever saw real ads anyway, of course. No one would watch something if it had the "ad" tag on it, but that didn't mean money wasn't changing hands. Rolph had known what he was seeing.

"Oh wow," Rolph said to his partner Clayton, "this completely unfunny clip that's gone viral for some inexplicable reason just happens to highlight that guy's $750 pair of shoes."

Clayton laughed.  "Better than this guy explaining this very specific pyramid scheme&mdash;for entertainment purposes only," he said.

But with ECHO it didn't make sense to pay an influencer to make a video like that because nobody could single-handedly push out millions of dollars in sales.  And the ecnomics didn't work out to pay enough of the population to lie about a product to make advertising work anymore.
